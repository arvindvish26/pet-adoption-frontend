                PetMate is a community-driven animal welfare initiative developed as part of our college project. The idea was inspired by the growing need for organized pet adoption and rescue platforms in India. The project aims to create a digital system that connects animal lovers, shelters, and veterinarians under one platform to promote responsible pet care and adoption.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Founded in 2025 by two passionate animal lovers, Sahil Rathore and Arvind Vishwakrama, PetMate began as a small effort to rescue and care for stray animals in their local neighborhood. What started with helping a few abandoned pets gradually evolved into a model of a full-fledged animal rescue and adoption organization serving urban areas across India.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Today, the project envisions a dedicated team of volunteers and staff who provide medical care, vaccination, behavioral training, and temporary shelter to rescued animals. PetMate also aims to collaborate with local veterinarians, NGOs, and animal welfare groups to ensure that every pet receives the care and attention it deserves.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                The organization follows a no-kill policy, ensuring that every healthy and treatable animal is given a chance to find a loving and permanent home â€” no matter how long it takes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Through this project, PetMate demonstrates how technology can be integrated with compassion to make the process of animal adoption, rescue management, and pet welfare more efficient and transparent in the Indian context.
